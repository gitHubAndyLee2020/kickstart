# Kickstart

Project Summary:

- This is a kickstart project build on the Ethereum blockchain.
- It allows the user to create a kickstart campaign to build a product where other users can donate Ether.
- In order to spend the donated Ether, the campaign creator can add requests to spend the Ether, where the donators can approve the request if they choose to.
- Once all the donators have approved a request, the request can be finalized and the Ether will be sent to the address specified in the request.
